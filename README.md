# Stock Advisor

Our goal is to analyze the risk and return factors of investing in the stock market vs. real estate stocks. We will be using the stocks of the S&P 500 to represent the stock market. For the real estate market we are using Zillow, Redfin and SPG where Zillow represents a real estate platform, Redfin represents a real estate broker and SPG represents REITs. In addition, we will also be analyzing the housing trends by taking a look at the housing price index and the median sale price for zillow and redfin.
